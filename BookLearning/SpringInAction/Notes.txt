-Spring in Action- 5th Ed

Essentials
• Spring application context ,  is a Spring container that creates and manages application components
• Beans ,  are those components to be managed
• DependencyInjection(DI) ,  is the  act of wiring beans together is based on a pattern
  (pg.6(28))
• Component Scanning ,  with it Spring can automatically discover components from an application’s
   classpath and create them as beans in the Spring application context
• Autowiring ,  with it Spring automatically injects the components with the other beans that they depend on
• Autoconfiguration ,  with it  Spring Boot can make reasonable guesses of what components need
   to be configured and wired together, based on entries in the classpath, environment variables,
   and other factors
• Spring Tools ,  extension for VSCode
  ♦ called by ctrl + shift + p > 'Spring Initializr'

  (pg.12(34))
• Points on Project Structure, in src/main/resources
  ♦ application.properties ,  place where you can specify configuration properties
  ♦ static/ ,  folder for static content (images, stylesheets, JavaScript, etc)
  ♦ templates/ ,  place for template files that will be used to render content to the browser
    ○ ie.: Thymleaf templates
• Why JAR?
  ♦ JAR packaging is a cloud-minded choice
  ♦ natural fit for most cloud platforms
  ♦ all Java cloud platforms are capable of running an executable JAR file
  ♦* the Spring Initializr defaults to JAR packaging unless you tell it to do otherwise
• Whereas WAR files are perfectly suitable for deploying to a traditional Java application server
  ♦ needs to include a web initializer class
