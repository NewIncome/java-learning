-Spring in Action- 5th Ed

Essentials
• Spring application context ,  is a Spring container that creates and manages application components
• Beans ,  are those components to be managed
• DependencyInjection(DI) ,  is the  act of wiring beans together is based on a pattern
  (pg.6(28))
• Component Scanning ,  with it Spring can automatically discover components from an application’s
   classpath and create them as beans in the Spring application context
• Autowiring ,  with it Spring automatically injects the components with the other beans that they depend on
• Autoconfiguration ,  with it  Spring Boot can make reasonable guesses of what components need
   to be configured and wired together, based on entries in the classpath, environment variables,
   and other factors
• Spring Tools ,  extension for VSCode
  ♦ called by ctrl + shift + p > 'Spring Initializr'

• Points on Project Structure, in src/main/resources          (pg.12(34))
  ♦ application.properties ,  place where you can specify configuration properties
  ♦ static/ ,  folder for static content (images, stylesheets, JavaScript, etc)
  ♦ templates/ ,  place for template files that will be used to render content to the browser
    ○ ie.: Thymleaf templates
• Why JAR?
  ♦ JAR packaging is a cloud-minded choice
  ♦ natural fit for most cloud platforms
  ♦ all Java cloud platforms are capable of running an executable JAR file
  ♦* the Spring Initializr defaults to JAR packaging unless you tell it to do otherwise
• Whereas WAR files are perfectly suitable for deploying to a traditional Java application server
  ♦ needs to include a web initializer class

• "Bootstrapping the Application"                             (pg.12(34))
  ♦ means starting the application's initial setup process
  ♦ This process typically involves:
    1. Loading Core Components: Loading essential classes and libraries into memory
    2. Initializing the Environment: Setting up system properties, environment variables, and configurations
    3. Creating the Main Container: For frameworks like Spring, it means creating the central
    container (like the ApplicationContext) that will manage all other components
• @SpringBootApplication
  ♦ is a composite application that combines three other
 annotations:
    1. @SpringBootConfiguration ,  this annotation is, in fact, a specialized form of the @Configuration annotatio
    2. @EnableAutoConfiguration ,  this annotation tells Spring Boot to automatically configure any components that it thinks you’ll need
    3. @ComponentScan ,  lets you declare other classes with annotations like @Component, @Controller, @Service, and others,
        to have Spring automatically discover them and register them as components in the Spring application context
  ♦ SpringApplication.run() performs the actual bootstrapping of the application, creating the Spring application context
    ○ .run( Configuration Class, Command-line arguments )

Writting a Spring Application
• @Controller ,  general purpose annotation, but used for better descriptiveness
• @GetMapping("/") ,  http get request handler
  ♦ The return value is interpreted as the logical name of a view
• The template for the 'home' view is in src/main/resources/templates/home.html
• Images should referenced with Thymeleaf are written as follows:
   <img th:src="@{/images/TacoCloud.png}"/>
  ♦ Thymeleaf uses th:src attribute and an @{...} expression to reference the image with a context relative path
• Images go in the dir src/main/resources/static/images/TacoCloud.png
• @WebMvcTest ,  is a special test-annotation provided by Spring Boot that arranges for the test to run in the context of a Spring MVC application
(pg.20(42))

• SpringBoot Dev Tools
  comes with:
  ♦ Automatic application restart when code changes
  ♦ Automatic browser refresh when browser-destined resources (such as templates, JavaScript, stylesheets, and so on) change
  ♦ Automatic disable of template caches
  ♦ Built in H2 Console if the H2 database is in use
    ○ Accesible at http://localhost:8080/h2-console , to gain insight into the data your application is working with
