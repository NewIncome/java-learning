• Formatting Outputs (pg.55)
  ♦ 1:  System.out.printf("The answer for %.3f divided by %d is %.2f.", 5.45, 3, 5.45/3);
    // 5.450 divided by 3 is 1.82.
    ○ % ,  'format-specifier'
    ○ .3 / 3 / etc ,  'flags'
    ○ f / d / n,  'converter' f:floating, d:decimal, n:newLine
  ♦ 2: Width flag.  System.out.printf("%8d", 12);
    //      12
  ♦ 3: Thousands separator flag(,).  System.out.printf("%,.2f", 12345.56789);
    //  12,345.57

• Specific Errors (pg.82)
  ♦ try {}
    catch(Error e){}
    catch(AnotherError e){}
    catch(Exception e)  // this catch block is for 'General Errors'
    finally{} //optional

• Autoboxing & Unboxing
  ♦ Autoboxing: converting from primitive type to object(Wrapper class), automatically
    ie.:  Integer intObject = new Integer(100);
          Integer intObject = 100;  //instead of the above, this will do the same, java in the background will do 'new ...'
  ♦ Unboxing: converting from Wrapper class(Object) to int(primitive type)
    ie.:  int m = intObject; //java autoamitcally gets only the value intObject.intValue();

    ie.:  int m = intObject; //java autoamitcally gets only the value intObject.intValue();

• File Handling
  ♦ Reading a text file:
    ○ We use 'BufferedReader' & 'FileReader' classes
     try{
      reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("myFile.txt"));
      line = reader.readLine();
      //... and continue doing so until the reader == null
     }
     //normal try-catch block like above needs closing BufferReader object
     try { if (reader != null) reader.close(); }
    ○ 'try-with-resources' statement
      used to avoid closing, use the try-catch block like so:
      ie.:  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("myFile.txt")))

  ♦ Writting to a text file:
    ○ We use 'BufferedWriter' & 'FileWriter' classes
    ○ This is done very similar to reading, but with two differences
    ie.:  try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new
 FileWriter("myFile2.txt", true)))
      1◙ if the file doesn't exist it will create it
      2◙ the 2nd argument in the FileWriter object
        ◘ if 'true', it will append the new info to the file
        ◘ if 'false' or default(not set), it will overwrite any existing data in the file

  ♦ File class
    ○ is used to manipulate file "paths", not to create or write files
    ○ .createNewFile() ,  File method to physically create a file
    ○ .getName() ,  File method to get the name of the file

  * There is also a "PrintWriter" class ...
    ○ Prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream

• Generics
  ○ allow us to create a single class, interface or method that automatically works with different types of data
  ○ Only works with 'Reference Types'
  ○ The use of 'Objects' as typeOfData inside < >
  ○ uses <T> ;  T is a type parameter
  *○ Another advantage of generics is it allows for type-checking
    ◙ Which when making use of it, we can define the typeOfData in the variable declaration to avoid errors in the use of the class methods
     ie.:  MyGenericsClass g1 = new MyGenericsClass();  //general input type
           MyGenericsClass<Integer> g2 = new MyGenericsClass();  //only Integer input type

  ○ Bounded Types
    ◙ to work with specific types, say numbers
    <T extends A>
    ◙ T can only accept data types that are subtypes of A
    ie.:  class MyGenericsClass2 <T extends Number>
      if we want our class to only work with numeric data types

    ◙ Upper bounds (extends): Restrict to a type and its SUBclasses.
    ◙ Lower bounds (super): Restrict to a type and its SUPERclasses.
    ◙ Unbounded (?): Accepts any type. (or Wildcard)
    ie.:  ? super Integer  means the list can accept Integer or any of its superclasses (e.g., Number, Object)
     public static void printNumbers(List<? super Integer> list)

      ?  means any type is accepted
     public static void printList(List<?> list) {

  ○ Multiple Bounds
    ◙ Multiple bounds allow you to restrict a generic type parameter to more than one type,
      combining a class with one or more interfaces
    ◙ Syntax:  <T extends ClassType & Interface1 & Interface2>
    ie.:  <T extends A & B & C>
    ◙ A type variable with multiple bounds is a subtype of all the types listed in the bound. If one of the bounds is a class, it must be specified first. For example:
    ie.:  Class A { /* ... */ }
          interface B { /* ... */ }
          interface C { /* ... */ }
    ◙** Only one of those bounds can be a class, and the rest must be interfaces

• Functional Interfaces & Lambda Expressions
  ○ Functional Interfaces ,  Interface that contains only one Abstract method
  ie.: @FunctionalInterface  # Not necessary; since methods in interfaces are anbstract by default
       interface MyNumber{
         double getValue();
       }
  ○ Lambda Expressions are used to implement FunctionalInterfaces
    ◙ Syntax:  (parameter list) -> lambda body
    ◙ Expression body: is a lambda block that has only 1 expression
    ◙ Block body:  is a lambda block that has  >1 expressions
  ○ Invoking a LambdaExpression with Functional Interfaces
    1. We cannot instantiate an Interface, hence we:
