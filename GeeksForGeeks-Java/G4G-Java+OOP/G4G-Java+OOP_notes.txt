--- Java OOP Concepts ---
Programming approach that organizes code into objects and classes
• A class is a blueprint that defines properties and behaviors
• while an Object is an instance of a class representing real-world entities

• Java Class: Is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created
  ○  a Class declaration usually includes: class modifiers, class-name, body
• Java Object: is a basic unit of OOP that represents real-life entities
  ○  An object mainly consists of: state(attr), behaviour(methods), identity, methods
*    ♦  In Java, every method must be part of some class

• Main 4 pilars are:
  ○ Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism

•1- Abstraction:
  ○  is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user
     is the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object, ignoring the irrelevant details
  ○  In Java  abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes
    ♦  We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.
•2- Encapsulation:
  ○  is the wrapping up of data under a single unit
      :. === “data-hiding”
  ○  Can be achieved by declaring all the variables in a class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of the variables
•3- Inheritance:
  ○  is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class
  ○  Important terminologies: superclass, subclass, reusability(derive our new class from the existing class)
•4- Polymorphism:
  ○  refers to the ability of object-oriented programming languages to differentiate between entities with the same name efficiently
     The ability to appear in many forms is called polymorphism.
  ○  it is done by Java with the help of the signature and declaration of these entities
  ○  Types of polymorphism in Java:
    ♦1. Method Overloading
      ◘  Also, known as Compile-Time polymorphism
      ◘  is the concept where more than one method share the same name with different signature(Parameters) in a class
    ♦2. Method Overriding
      ◘  Also, known as Run-Time polymorphism
      ◘  is the concept of Polymorphism where method in the child class has the same name, return-type and parameters as in parent class
          The child class provides the implementation in the method already written


-- Classes And Objects --
• Class is a logical entity
• Object is a physical entity
• No memory is allocated when a Class is declared
• Memory is allocated as soon as an Object is created

• In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:
  ○  Modifiers, Class keyword, Class name, Superclass (if any), Interfaces(if any), Body

• An object consists of:
  ○  State(attr/prop), Behaviour(methods), Identity(uniq name, enables interaction)
•* //Objects (non-primitive types) are always allocated on the heap, while their reference variables are stored on the stack.
• Declaring Objects, is also called Instantiating a Class

• Ways to Create an Object of a Class:
  ○1. Using new Keyword
  ○2. Using Reflection (Dynamic Class Loading)
    ♦  Reflection is a powerful feature in Java that allows a program to inspect and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime
    ie.:  Class<?> c = Class.forName(“Student”);
          Student s2 = (Student) c.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
* ○  Note: Reflection is used in frameworks like Spring for "dependency injection"
  ○3. Using clone() method
    ie.: Test t1 = new Test();
         Test t2 = (Test)t1.clone();
  ○4. Deserialization
    ♦  De-serialization is a technique of reading an object from the saved state in a file

• Creating Multiple Objects by one type only (A good practice)
  ○  Creating a number of references for storing them is not a good practice and therefore we declare a static reference variable and use it whenever required.
  ○  In the inheritance system, we use a parent class reference variable to store a sub-class object. In this case, we can switch into different subclass objects using the same referenced variable.
  ie.:  class Animal {} 
        class Dog extends Animal {} 
        class Cat extends Animal {} 
        public class Test {    
          // using Dog object     
          Animal obj = new Dog();     
          // using Cat object     
          obj = new Cat(); 
        }

• Anonymous Objects in Java
  ○ are objects that are instantiated without storing their reference in a variable. They are used for one-time operations
  ○ Common in event handling
  ie.:  button.setOnAction(event -> System.out.println(“Button clicked!”)); // Anonymous object via lambda
        stage.setScene(new Scene(root, 300, 200));


-- Constructors --
A constructor is a special block of code that is called when an object is created
This process happens automatically when we use the “new” keyword to create an object
• Characteristics:
  ○  Same Name as the Class
  ○  No Return Type
  ○  Automatically Called on Object Creation
  ○  Used to Set Initial Values for Object Attributes
•* The first line of a constructor is a call to super() or this(),
(a call to a constructor of a super-class or an overloaded constructor),
if you don’t type in the call to super in your constructor the compiler will
provide you with a non-argument call to super at the first line of your code,
the super constructor must be called to create an object
class Geeks {
    // Constructor
    Geeks()
    {
        super();
        System.out.println("Constructor Called");
    }

    // main function
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Geeks geek = new Geeks();
    }
}
• Rules for writing constructors are as follows:
  ○  The constructor of a class must have the same name as the class name in which it resides.
  ○  A constructor in Java can not be abstract, final, static, or Synchronized.
  ○  Access modifiers can be used in constructor declaration to control its access i.e which other class can call the constructor.
• Types of Constructors in Java:
  ○1  Default Constructor
  ○2  Parameterized Constructor
  ○3  Copy Constructor
    ie.:  Geeks(Geeks obj2)
•* Note: There are no “return value” statements in the constructor, but the constructor returns the current class instance. We can write ‘return’ inside a constructor.
• Constructor Overloading:  This allows us to create multiple constructors in the same class with different parameter lists.
• Common Mistakes to Avoid:
  ○  Forgetting super() in Child Classes: Always call the parent constructor (super()) if the parent class has no default constructor, or it will lead to compilation errors.
  ○  Excessive Work in Constructors: Keep constructors simple and focused on initialization, avoiding heavy logic that slows down object creation.
  ○  Not Handling Null Checks: Always validate parameters to avoid NullPointerException when constructing objects.


-- Class --
• Object Class Methods:
  ○  toString(), hashCode(), equals(), finalize(), getClass(), clone(), wait(), notify() notifyAll() (Concurrency methods)
• Object.toString() ,  provides a custom string representation for a class
  ie.:  // Person{name:'Geek'}
•* //Note: It is generally necessary to override the hashCode() method whenever the equals() method is overridden, so as to maintain the general contract for the hashCode method, which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes.
  ie.:
  public class Student {
    int roll;
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return roll;
    }
    ...
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o instanceof Student) {
            return this.roll == ((Student) o).roll;
        }
        return false;
    }
    ...
  }
• getClass() ,  returns the class object of “this” object and is used to get the actual runtime class of the object
  ie.: // java.lang.String
• finalize() ,  this method is called just before an object is garbage collected
  ○  It is called the Garbage Collector on an object when the garbage collector determines that there are no more references to the object
  ○  We should override finalize() method to dispose of system resources, perform clean-up activities and minimize memory leaks
  ○  Note: The finalize method is called just once on an object even though that object is eligible for garbage collection multiple times
• Concurrency Methods: wait(), notify(), and notifyAll()
  ○  These methods are related to thread Communication in Java. They are used to make threads wait or notify others in concurrent programming


-- Abstraction --
Is the process of hiding the implementation details and only showing the essential details or features to the user
  ○ Thus reducing complexity and improving maintainability
• It allows to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it
• Abstract classes may have methods without implementation and must be implemented by subclasses
•* An Abstract class cannot be instantiated
• By abstracting functionality, changes in the implementation do not affect the code that depends on the abstraction
• Java provides 2 ways to implement abstraction:
  ○  Abstract Classes (Partial Abstraction)
  ○  Interface (100% Abstraction)
• Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of "'identifying' only the required characteristics" of an object ignoring the irrelevant details
ie.:
  abstract class Geeks {        // Abstract Class
      abstract void turnOn();   // Abstract Method
      abstract void turnOff();
  }
  // "Concrete" class implementing the abstract methods
  class TVRemote extends Geeks {
      @Override
      void turnOn() {
          System.out.println("TV is turned ON.");
      }
      @Override
      void turnOff() {
          System.out.println("TV is turned OFF.");
      }
  }
• The concrete classes are used to contain the program logic.

- Interface -
• In Java or any other language, interfaces include both methods and variables but lack a method body
• To implement an interface we use the keyword “implements” with class
• Apart from abstraction, interfaces can also be used to implement inheritance in Java
  ie.:
  interface Shape { double calculateArea(); }
  class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public double calculateArea() { return length * width; }
  }

• Abstraction Best Practices:
  ○  Use abstract classes when you need a common base class with shared functionality.
  ○  Use interfaces when you need multiple inheritance or 100% abstraction.
  ○  Keep your interfaces small and focused. Don’t put unrelated methods into a single interface.


-- Encapsulation --
Is a technique used to protect an object’s data from unauthorized access
  ○  By using 'private' fields(instance variables)
  ○  and providing public accessor methods(getter, setter)
  ○  Thus ensuring data protection, security, and flexibility
• Advantages:
  ○  Data Hiding, Data Integrity, Reusability, and Testing code is easy
• Best Practice bullet:
  ○  Validate Data Before Modifying


-- Inheritance --
Mechanism by which one class is allowed to inherit features(fields and methods) of another class
• Basically means: creating new classes based on existing ones
• Inheritance promotes:
  ○  code reusability, method overriding, and polymorphism
    ♦  which makes the Java program more modular and efficient
• It's implemented using the 'extends' keyword
• The class that inherits is called the 'subclass' (child class)
• The class being inherited from is called the 'superclass' (parent class)
• Basic syntax:  class ChildClass extends ParentClass { ... }
• Types of Inheritance:
  ○  Single Inheritance ,  single-parent class (A <- B)
  ○  Multilevel Inheritance ,  (A <- B <- C)
  ○  Hierarchical Inheritance,  (B -> A <- C), (A <- B, A <- C, A <- D)
    ♦  one class serves as a superclass (base class) for more than one subclass
  ○  Multiple Inheritance ,  (A <- C, B <- C) == (A <- C -> B) 
    ♦  one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes
    ♦  We can achieve multiple inheritances only through 'Interfaces'
  ○  Hybrid Inheritance ,  ()
    ♦  We can achieve hybrid inheritance only through Interfaces
    ♦  We can achieve this with Multiple-Inheritance
    ♦  And also with MultiLevel and Hierarchical-Inheritance 
•* //A class cannot directly access the grandparent’s members if they are private

• In a subclass, we can:
  ○  Override superclass methods, using the same signature
  ○  write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword 'super'
  ○  write a new 'static' method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus 'hiding' it
• Advantages of Inheritance:
  ○  Code Reusability, Abstraction, Class Hierarchy, Polymorphism
• Disadvantages:
  ○  Complexity, Tight Coupling

• Default superclass: (single inheritance) every class has one and only one direct superclass
• Constructors, aren't inherited, but can be invoked
• A subclass does'nt inherit 'private' members of its parent class
  ○  But 'publi' and 'protected' methods are inherited

***
• The 'super' keyword allows access to the immediate parent class's methods or constructors.


-- Polymorphism --
It's the ability of objects to behave differently based on their specific class type
• Key features:
  ○  Multiple Behaviors, Method Overriding,
     Method Overloading, Runtime Decision

• Types of Polymorphism
  ○1- Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static)
    |- Method Overloading  :dueTo
  ○2- Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic)
    |- Method Overriding
    |- Virtual Functions


-- Method Overloading --
Allows us to define multiple methods with the same name but different signature
  ○  Signature:  the name + parameters of a method, return type doen't matter
  ○*  changing the order of the parameters also counts, as a different signature
• Method overloading is also known as Compile-time Polymorphism,
  Static Polymorphism, or Early binding,
  because the decision about which method to call is made at compile time
  ○  when a method could take child & parent type, Java prefers the more specific child type
• If the exact prototype(primitives) doesn't match, Java Converts it to a higher type(in terms of range)
• Advantages
  ○  Increase flexibility and improve the readability of code
• Disadvantages:
  ○  Confusion for developers
  ○  Improper use may lead to ambiguity in method selection


-- Method Overriding  --
Occurs when a subclass or child class implements a method that is already defined in the superclass or base class.
• The subclass method must match the parent class method’s name, parameters, and return type
• Static methods cannot be overridden
  ○  Only Instance methods
• Enables Run-time polymorphism,
  ○  because the method called depends on the object type at runtime
• Advantages:
  ○  Reuse method names logically instead of creating new ones for minor changes
  ○  Can modify Parent 'private' method to public
  ○  But a 'private' Parent method can't be overridden
  ○  Also a method declared as 'final' cannot be overridden

• Overriding is for Instance Methods
  +  Java checks for the -Object Type- , to choose the method
• Hiding is for Static/Class Methods
  +  Java checks for the -Variable Type- , to choose the method
  ie.:  VariableType variableName = new ObjectType();
        ReferenceType
  ○* // NOT common in GOOD or Well DESIGNS !!!!!  <<== <==< <-

Rules for Java Method Overriding
1. Access Modifiers in overriding: can make an overridden method More Accessible
  ○  literally ONLY from 'protected' -> to 'public'
  ie.:  upgrade protected to public, but not less
2. Final Methods Cannot Be Overriden. Produces an Error
3. Static Methods Cannot Be Overridden (Method Hiding), they can be 'Hidden'
4. Private Methods Cannot Be Overridden. Produces an Error
5. Method Must Have the Same Return Type (or subtype). == 'covariant' return type
6. Invoking Parent’s Overridden Method Using super
  ie.:  super.methodName();
//* Abstract methods in an interface or abstract class are meant to be overridden
//* We cannot override the constructor as the parent and child class can never have a constructor with the same name
- Exception-Handling in Overriding -
There are Two rules to note when overriding methods related to exception handling
• Rule 1: If the super-class overridden method does not throw an exception, the subclass overriding method can only throw the unchecked exception,
  throwing a checked exception will lead to a compile-time error. 
  ○  'Un-checked exception' ,  is/are runtime exceptions, like: ArithmeticException, ClassCastException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArrayStoreException, IllegalThreadStateException
    ♦  they are derived from "RuntimeException"
    ♦//'checked exception' are derived from "Exception"
• Rule 2: If the superclass overridden method does throw an exception, the subclass overriding method can only throw the same, subclass exception.
  ○  Also, there is no issue if the subclass overridden method does not throw any exception.

//...*
Overriding and Synchronized/strictfp Method
The presence of a synchronized/strictfp modifier with the method has no effect on the rules of overriding, i.e. it’s possible that a synchronized/strictfp method can override a non-synchronized/strictfp one and vice-versa.


//* ==========================================================
  * --- Final Keyword ---
  * The final Keyword in Java is used as a non-access modifier applicable to a variable, a method, or a class.
  * Quick overview:
  * Final Variable  -->  to Create a constant variable
  * Final Method    -->  to Prevent Method Overriding
  * Final Classes   -->  to Prevent Inheritance
  * *They all produce an Error.
  * ==========================================================

-- Packages --
Are a mechanism that encapsulates a group of classes, sub-packages, and interfaces.
• By grouping related classes into packages, Java promotes 'data encapsulation', making code reusable and easier to manage
• What for?
  ○  Prevent naming conflicts
  ○  Ease of organization, location
  ○  Controlled access for Protected packages and subclasses
  ○  default members (no access specifier) are accessible only within the same package
  ○  Simply import the desired class from a package to use it in your program
• Folder Structure:
  - Program
  |- JavaProgramming
   |- arrays
    |- twoPointers.java
  inside the file use:  package JavaProgramming.arrays;
  ○  Now you can do:
    ♦  javac src\JavaProgramming\arrays\TwoPointers.java
    ♦  java src\JavaProgramming\arrays\TwoPointers.java  ...it's .class

• Naming Conventions: Package names are written in reverse order of domain names

• Types of packages
  ○  Built-in Packages:
consist of a large number of classes which are a part of Java API, like:
    ♦  java.lang, java.io, java.util, java.applet, java.net, java.awt(for graphical user interfaces, like buttons, menus)
  ○  User-defined packages

• Static Import
  ○  Static Import in Java is about simplifying access to static members
  ○  allows members (fields and methods) defined in a class as public static to be used in Java code without specifying the class in which the field is defined
  ie.:  import static java.lang.System.*;
        out.println("GeeksforGeeks");  //this can be done

• Handling Name Conflicts
  ○  if both are to be used, we must use the full package name
  ie.:  java.util.Date deadLine = new java.util.Date();
        java.sql.Date today = new java.sql.Date();

• Access Modifiers in the Context of Packages
  ○  Public ,  accessible from anywhere, regardless of whether the accessing class is in the same package or not
  ○  Protected ,  accessible within the same package, accessible by subclasses
  ○  Default ,  accessible only within the same package, not accessible by subclasses
  ○  Private ,  accessible only within the same class

• Important Points:
  ○  Every class is part of some package.
  ○  If no package is specified, the classes in the file goes into a special unnamed package (the same unnamed package for all files).
  ○  All classes/interfaces in a file are part of the same package. Multiple files can specify the same package name.
  ○  If package name is specified, the file must be in a subdirectory called name (i.e., the directory name must match the package name).
  ○  We can access public classes in another (named) package using: package-name.class-name
