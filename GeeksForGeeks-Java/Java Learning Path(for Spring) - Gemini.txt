Absolutely Essential Before Starting Spring:

1. Core Java Fundamentals: You need to be comfortable with the basic syntax, data types,
   control flow, and fundamental building blocks of Java.
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Spring is heavily based on OOP principles.
   Understanding encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction is critical
   for grasping Spring's core concepts like Dependency Injection and Aspect-Oriented
   Programming.
4. Exception Handling: You'll encounter exceptions in Spring applications, so knowing how
   to handle them is essential.
5. Java Collections Framework: Spring applications frequently work with collections of
   objects. A good understanding of Lists, Sets, and Maps is necessary.
6. Interfaces in Detail: Spring relies heavily on interfaces for abstraction and loose
   coupling. You need to understand what interfaces are and how they are used in Java.
7. Functional Interfaces & 8. Lambda Expressions & 9. Method References: While you can
   technically start with older versions of Spring without these, modern Spring development
   (especially with Spring Boot) makes extensive use of them. Understanding these concepts
   will significantly improve your ability to write concise and expressive Spring code,
   especially when dealing with Streams, reactive programming (Spring WebFlux), and functional
   bean definitions.

Highly Recommended (Will Make Your Spring Journey Much Smoother):
10. Java Stream API: Spring often uses Streams for data processing and manipulation.
   Familiarity with Streams will be very beneficial.
19. Build Tools (Maven or Gradle): Spring projects almost universally use build tools like
   Maven or Gradle for dependency management and building. Learning the basics of one of these
   is highly recommended early on.

Less Critical to Start, But Important to Learn Eventually:
11. Input/Output (I/O): While Spring handles a lot of I/O for web applications, a deep dive
   into all aspects of Java I/O isn't strictly necessary to begin with. You'll pick up relevant
   parts as needed.
12. Concurrency: While Spring provides abstractions for concurrency, a deep understanding of
   low-level Java concurrency isn't a prerequisite for basic Spring web development. However,
     for more complex applications or performance-critical scenarios, it becomes important.
13. Networking: Basic understanding is helpful if you're building web applications or interacting
   with other services, but a detailed knowledge of Java networking isn't required initially.
14. JVM Internals, 15. Annotations (Advanced), 16. Reflection, 17. Security (Advanced): These are
   more advanced topics that you'll likely delve into as you become more experienced with Spring
   and encounter specific needs or performance issues. Spring itself uses these concepts
   extensively, but you don't need to fully understand their inner workings to start building
   applications.
18. Testing (Basic Unit Testing with JUnit): Knowing how to write basic unit tests is very helpful
   for any development, including Spring. You should aim to learn JUnit basics relatively early.
20. Version Control (Git): Essential for any software development, including Spring projects.
   Learn the basics of Git early on.
21. Design Patterns (Basic Understanding): Familiarity with common design patterns will help you
   understand the design principles behind Spring (e.g., Dependency Injection is a form of Inversion
   of Control). You don't need to know them all by heart, but recognizing common patterns will be beneficial.

In summary, to start working with the Spring Framework effectively, focus on:
  • Solid Core Java and OOP fundamentals.
  • Understanding Interfaces in detail.
  • Embrace Functional Interfaces, Lambdas, and Method References.
  • Get a basic grasp of the Java Collections Framework and the Stream API.
  • Learn the basics of a build tool like Maven or Gradle.
  • Understand basic unit testing with JUnit.
  • Familiarize yourself with Git.

You can learn the more advanced Java topics and design patterns as you progress with Spring and encounter
situations where that knowledge becomes necessary. Spring itself will expose you to many of these concepts
in a practical context.
Don't feel like you need to become a Java expert in every single area before touching Spring. Jump in,
start building simple Spring applications, and learn the underlying Java concepts as you go. This hands-on
approach can be very effective!
