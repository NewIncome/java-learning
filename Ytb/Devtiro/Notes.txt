Spring Rest API development
----------------------------

► Coding Steps
---------------
1- https://start.spring.io
2- Dependencies add: "Spring Web"
3- 


► Maven Concepts
-----------------
• Apache Maven
  ○ Helper to manage projects and all needed to build, test, package-it
  ○ MVN has 3 main phases or Life-cycles, with certain goals in each
    ♦ each name is also the mvn command to be used
    ♦ clean   - remove temp dirs and files
      ◙ pre-clean   - hooks for before cleaning
      ◙ clean       - the actual cleaning
      ◙ post.clean  - hooks for after cleaning
    ♦ 2. default - where most useful goals live
      //* if called 'default' it will run the goals in order
      ◙ compile   - compiles code into bytecode
      ◙ test      - runs unit tests
      ◙ package   - creates a jar or war file
      ◙ verify    - runs checks and integration tests
      //* if you run a specific goal-command, it'll run the previous goals
    ♦ 3. site    - where documentation is generated

  ○ 'target' directory
    ♦ is where all th eproject is actually being built
    ♦ which is what gets cleaned out in the 'clean phase'
  ○ 'src/main/resources/application.properties
    ♦ this is where we would configure our app
     ie.: with other file to load etc.
    ♦ the Tests dir also has a the same dir/file for config

  ○ Commands while developing
  // $ mvn clean test  //is a good way to make sure everything is ok before testing
  // $ java -jar restapi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  //to run the compiled file as we would in production. And can bee seen as if run normally; port 8080
      this being inside the target/ directory
  // $ mvn spring-boot:run
    ♦ clean > compile > run/test


► Spring Framework
--------------
By itself is highly configurable, but a lof of work
• LAYERS
  ♦ Presentation ,  use all the data from the 'Service layer' and expose it to the user
    ◙ with a RestAPI which uses controllers for implementation
      or a GraphQL-API, or WebSockets-API
  ♦ Service ,  use all of the functionality exposed by the 'persistence layer'
      and use it to meet the requirements our application is built to handle
    ◙ with Services
  ♦ Presistence ,  handles interactions with our DB
    ◙ with Entities
    ◙ with Repository patterns, and DAO's patterns (DataAccessObject) - CRUD


► Spring Boot
--------------
Is a layer built on top of -Spring Framework-
• Puspose is to provide additional functionality
• Helps managing and creating Beans and Interfaces, by sensible defaults

▲ IOC, DependencyInjection
• What the Framework does? Provides and injects the classes/dependencies/Beans
• We just need to make the Interfaces for our main class
• Ways of configuring Beans:
  ♦ by the @Configuration class
  ♦ by the @Component annotation (& friends)

▲ Component Scanning
