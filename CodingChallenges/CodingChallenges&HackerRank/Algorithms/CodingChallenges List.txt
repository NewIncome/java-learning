List of Coding Challenges, Algorithms
--------------------------
❌  didn't pass any, not finished, not understood
/  passed >= half test cases || passedWithVideo
✔  done

[✔] - ApplesAndOranges
[✔] - NumberLineJumps  (can further understand a Math approach)
[✔] - BetweenTwoSets  (wV)
[✔] - SubarrayDivision  (Success)
[✔] - Migratory Birds  (wV)
[✔] - Day of the Programmer  (Success_long)
[✔] - Drawing Book  (got to 1TCfailed)
[/] - Forming a Magic Square  (❌, not fully understood)
[/] - Climbing the Leaderboard  (wV) (❌)
[✔] - Designer PDF Viewer (Success)
[✔] - Utopian Tree  (Success)
[✔] - Viral Advertising  (Success)
[✔] - Save the Prisoner!  (wV)
[✔] - Circular Array Rotation (timeLimitExceeded)(2ndDay Passed)
[✔] - Sequence Equation  (understood wV)
[✔] - Jumping on the Clouds: Revisited (video helpedABit, was missing parenthesis)
[✔] - Extra Long Factorials (passed w-forLoop, w-help for recursion)
[✔] - Append and Delete (passed 10/12)(w-vid, needs better understanding)(understood w-HR-Discussions)
[✔] - Sherlock and Squares (w-vid, needs better understanding)
[✔] - Library Fine (finished, had2refactor4edgeCase)
[/] - Cut the sticks (passed 1 tc) (❌)
[✔] - Non-Divisible Subset (passed wV) (❌, sortOfUnderstood, could do better)
[✔] - Equalize the Array (passedOk)
[✔] - Queen's Attack II (/,passed 18/22,timeLimitExc) (tookAlmost4days to get it by myself(atTheEnd withLittleAIhelp))
[✔] - ACM ICPC Team (❌, passed 1) (passed, do less operations inside nested loop with an outer loop and an array var for convOfInitData)
      //the difference was only of 0.3seconds
[✔] - TaumAndB'day (passed 7/14), 2ndTry(8/14), 3rdTry(needed BigInteger!!!)
[✔] - Organizing Containers of Balls (2/7)(bad Approach for very large cases)(❌)(4th Try w-AI, wrong understanding of the problem)
      //MUST ASSUME(or musn't assume opposite), containers are not fixed with/for a specific ballType
[✔] - Encryption (took too long with var-types, the loops, and loop-cond for different sized strings)
[ ] -
